# MNIST-Dataset-Using-Tensorflow
Here we are analyzing the MNIST dataset using tensorflow and the "Adam" optimizer is used the get with the optimum cost .The whole dataset is passed in batches of 100 in each iteration and we are iterating for 25 times during training our data. After that we are getting the predictions of the testing data and the accuracy of our predictions.
